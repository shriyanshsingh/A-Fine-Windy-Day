# A-Fine-Windy-Day

## Introduction
Hello fellow participants! Welcome to the Wind Turbine Power Prediction challenge. In this competition, we have the exciting opportunity to leverage Machine Learning techniques to address a critical issue - predicting the power generated by wind turbines. As climate warriors, we're tasked with creating a sophisticated model that can contribute to the global transition towards cleaner energy sources.

## Problem Statement
In the year 2021, our planet faces the urgent challenge of climate change. With global warming reaching alarming levels and fossil fuels depleting rapidly, the need for clean energy alternatives is paramount. Developing countries worldwide are striving to shift towards sustainable energy solutions, and one such solution is wind turbines. These turbines harness wind energy to generate power. The goal of this challenge is to build a Machine Learning model that accurately predicts the power generated by wind turbines based on various influencing factors.

### Dataset
The provided dataset includes a range of parameters that affect wind turbine power generation:

### Temperature
Wind direction
Turbine status
Weather conditions
Blade length
These features play a crucial role in determining the amount of power a wind turbine can produce. Our task is to analyze this data, train a Machine Learning model, and make predictions about the power output of wind turbines.
